# Culinary Community
A place to meet and share your culinary culture with your local community

## Our mission
Our mission with this project was to allow people in local communities to organize events and connect with one another. We realized that food is an important part of every culture, so we figured that connecting people through their cultural foods would be a great way to bring people closer together. We give people the opportunity to organize live food-related events and share their favorite recipes.
